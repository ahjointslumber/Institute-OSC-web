The IMeRG at the University of Melbourne will be hosting the 2019 Australasian Meta-Research and Open Science Meeting.

We welcome interested students and researchers to join us for two days of workshops, hackathons, and presentations about a broad range of open science and scientific reform topics, including: pre-registration and Registered Reports; peer review and scientific publishing; using R for analysis; open source experimental programming; meta-research; replicability; improving statistical and scientific inference; diversity in scientific community and practice; and methodological and scientific culture change.
